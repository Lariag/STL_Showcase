AboutWindowMessage The cache folder contains the auto-generated images of your 3D models.\nThose images are generated when a new model is loaded, so the next time a image of the model is needed, it won't be necessary to read all the geometry and render it.\n\nImages will be generated in different sizes and colors depending on your settings.
